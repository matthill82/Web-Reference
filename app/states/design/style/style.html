				<p class="stw-text-introduction">The
					Severn Trent Design System (stw) component library is actively developed to enable Severn Trent
					developers to create a uniform look and feel across all Severn Trent-related applications while adhering to
					CSS best practices and conventions.</p>

				<p>In order to accomplish this goal, we’ve chosen to use very specific naming techniques. These allow us to
					keep our code base flat, with low specificity, and keeps us from fighting specificity wars that start
					with frustration and end with <code>!important</code>. Though we base our naming on the BEM method, we
					have a few additions of our own outlined below.</p>

				<h2 class="stw-text-heading--large">BEM Naming</h2>

				<p><a href="https://en.bem.info/">BEM</a> is a well-known method of naming components — block, element,
					modifier. If you’re comfortable with BEM, move down to the “Where we diverge from BEM” section. For
					those unfamiliar or who need a quick refresh, let’s briefly look at how BEM works. As an example, we’ll
					build a house component.</p>

				<h3 class="stw-text-heading--medium">Block</h3>

				<p>A block represents the main component name. If you were building a house component, the class name would
					be <code>.house</code>. All of the properties you want included for all houses would be included in the
					base <code>.house</code> class.</p>

				<h3 class="stw-text-heading--medium">Element</h3>

				<p>An element represents a part of a component and is separated by two underscores. The door of the house
					would be represented by the class <code>.house__door</code>. A window would be
					<code>.house__window</code>.</p>

				<p>Be careful to look for smaller component possibilities within a larger component. Especially if it’s a
					pattern that might be repeated in an unrelated component. Avoid using a class like <code>.house__stair__step</code>.
					Instead, either use <code>.house__stair-step</code> (a single dash does not indicate anything in BEM and
					can simply be used for compound naming). Or if the stair portion of the component might be used inside
					another component, make the <code>.stair</code> a smaller component within the larger component and use
					<code>.stair__step</code> as an element of it.</p>

				<h3 class="stw-text-heading--medium">Modifier</h3>

				<p>A modifier is a component or element variation and is separated by two dashes. The variation can apply to
					the overall component or it can be applied to an element within the component.</p>

				<p>Since the properties that should apply to every house are placed on the main <code>.house</code> class,
					all houses receive the <code>.house</code> class as the base. If there is a variation of a house —
					perhaps it is gray — the <code>.house--gray</code> class would be added to the component in addition to
					the <code>.house</code> class.</p>

				<p>If the house has a pink door, a variation can be placed on the door element itself — <code>.house__door--pink</code>.
				</p>

				<h2 class="stw-text-heading--large">Where we diverge from BEM</h2>

				<p>In some cases, for reasons of brevity and comprehension, we’ve added to, or deviated from, typical BEM
					naming conventions. These changes are outlined below.</p>

				<h3 class="stw-text-heading--medium">Utility Classes</h3>

				<p>Though BEM syntax is traditionally based off an initial block, in some cases (in our utilities) we have
					opted to remove that requirement. For example, margin and padding are indicated with the formula <code>.m-top--medium</code>
					(margin, top, medium). So while there is no base <code>.m</code> or <code>.m-top</code> class as a base
					class, we feel it’s an easily understandable way to indicate that there is a size variation in these
					utility classes.</p>

				<p>Our spacing utilities similarly use the syntax <code>.size--1-of-2</code> without a base
					<code>.size</code> class. Text sizing uses class names like <code>.text-body--small</code> and <code>.text-heading--large</code>
					without a base <code>.text-body</code> or <code>.text-heading class</code>.</p>

				<h3 class="stw-text-heading--medium">Component Containers</h3>

				<p>Though generic <code>.container</code> classes exist, sometimes a component has an optional container —
					but it is specific to that component alone. Those containers should be indicated by a class using a
					single underscore. For example, when a <code>.pill</code> has an optional container applied, that class
					is written as <code>.pill_container</code>.</p>

				<h3 class="stw-text-heading--medium">Namespacing</h3>

				<p>In order to make this framework easy to use with other frameworks, we’ve added the <code>.stw-</code>
					namespace. Rather than using <code>.button</code>, our framework uses <code>.stw-button</code>. This
					allows you to integrate the Lightning Design System (stw) with your own bespoke CSS or to integrate it
					with an application that uses the modified Severn Trent Bootstrap framework previously used as you wean
					your application away from it.</p>

				<h3 class="stw-text-heading--medium">Scoping</h3>

				<p>In some cases, when you don’t have full control of the DOM (for example, when integrating with
					Visualforce, Lightning Components or another framework), you may need to scope components built with
					stw. In this case, three different versions of the CSS framework are available in the download.</p>

				<p>The components built from stw should have the class <code>.stw</code> at the highest level of the DOM
					where they’re included. In some cases this will be a wrapper at the component level, in other cases you
					may wrap several components. Do not place <code>.stw</code> on the body level of the application if you
					are including non-stw components within it. This would cause the non-stw components to be scoped and
					may override expected styles with negative effects.</p>

				<h2 class="stw-text-heading--large">Component States</h2>

				<p>When a component has a variety of states, we add a class to indicate the state the component, or certain
					portions of the component, are in. Some examples are: <code>.is-selected</code>, <code>.is-active</code>,
					<code>.is-expanded</code>, <code>.is-nested</code>, <code>.is-open</code>, <code>.has-focus</code>,
					<code>.has-error</code>, etc.</p>
